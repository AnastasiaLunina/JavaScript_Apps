# eslint-config-live

> A shareable eslint configuration for the Live Ecosystem

## Notes

Ideally we would like to extend a well-established config like `eslint-config-airbnb`. However eslint's resolution algorithm for plugins means they have to be peer dependencies, meaning they need to be manually installed. So we don't use any for now. Tracking issue here: https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/3458.
